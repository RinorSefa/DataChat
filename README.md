# Project Description 

The task is to develop a Python-based solution that leverages OpenAI's language model to enable interactive conversations with SQL/tabular data or CSV files without the need to write any SQL queries. The goal is to create a user-friendly and code-free environment where users can ask questions about the data using natural language and receive accurate and explained results. The project requires integrating OpenAI's language model with Python and implementing the necessary logic to handle data retrieval and interpretation.

## Steps
 1. Locate your API key
 2. Set the environment variable (OPENAI_API_KEY)
